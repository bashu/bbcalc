===============

1.1 Installing on some Linux distributions

	1.1.1 Debian GNU/Linux and Ubuntu

		# aptitude install bbcalc
	
1.2 Installing from source

	Unpack the BBCalc tarball using these commands:

		$ tar -zxf bbcalc-<version>.tar.gz

	Switch to the newly created directory and type as root:
	
		# make install

	The Makefile will copy the files to the correct location in your
	system. You do not need to configure or compile BBCalc as it is
	written in interpreted Python code.

1.3 Installing from downloaded package

	If you have downloaded BBCalc package, just do as root:

	* deb packages (Debian, Ubuntu, ...)

		# dpkg -i bbcalc_<version>_all.deb

1.4 Making Debian package

	If you want to make your own Debian package, follow these steps:

	* change your working directory to bbcalc source
	* edit debian/changelog file, f.e. like this:

		$ dch -v <version> -D UNRELEASED -i NOT RELEASED YET

	* type `debuild` or `dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot` to build package
	* install new package (`dpkg -i ../bbcalc_<version>_all.deb`)
